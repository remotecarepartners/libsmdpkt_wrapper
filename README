# libsmdpkt_wrapper
wrapper to get ofonod and qmicli working on smdpkt devices (MSM kernel's SMD)

/*
 * This is intended as a LD_PRELOAD'ed library. It will look for open()s of
 * char devices driven by smdpkt. When seen, the SMD_PKT_IOCTL_BLOCKING_WRITE
 * ioctl will be issued, and poll() calls specifying POLLOUT will act as if
 * the device is always ready to be written to. (POLLOUT on smdpkt is not supported
 * in the kernel.)
 *
 * Because of the missing POLLOUT support, ofonod and qmicli don't work on SMD
 * devices (they hang waiting to write), but with this wrapper they do.
 *
 * The ioctl is used by the proprietary qmuxd daemon, and I *think* it makes sense
 * to move the waiting from poll() to write().
 *
 * Presumably the poll() fix would be a two-line kernel patch mirroring the
 * support for POLLIN, but I'd rather not mess with kernel code.
 *
 * For simplicity and efficiency, we assume only one smd device will be opened,
 * and not closed.
